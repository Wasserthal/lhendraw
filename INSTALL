dependencies:
- SDL - in any distro. be sure to install the sdl-dev, too!
- freetype - in any distro be sure to install freetype-dev, too!
- gcc - check your distro
- g++ - check your distro
- glibc/math (should be present anyway)
- make (not totally necessary)
- 32bit x86 processor(i386), 64bit x86 processor (AMD_K64)

how to install
type 

make sdl
sudo make install

if compiling worked, there should be a executable file called lhendraw.

build system - for advanced users

Steps of building:

1. in the /generated/ folder, there are some files which are automatically generated with the tools in /tools/,
* from files that end in .draft = for reflective data structures ; by tools/filestructure
* from .hxx files which contain macro lists only and are additionally directly included = to create defined numberings ; tools/reflection_enums
* from files that end in .pullout.hxx = for menu's and their actions ; these units are directly included into the tool-program., as well as other menus.
* from all .hxx files which contain the string typedef struct, these definitions will be read and converted to lists which are indexed in a master list. The strings in them are used to create the datastructure tree the user can edit directly.
It is the aim to have all global variables reflected.

2. Build system consists of .c or .cxx files, which pearl-necklace-type includes all components of the program with #include and contains some main function with entry point/main loop


when compiling fails:
look in the corresponding .c or .cxx file (usually lhendraw.cxx) if you could add/remove some include on the top.
This is because some distroes use different includes, and
