ARROWS:

Head at END of Major Axis.
(graphic-as-arrow has usual head at START! (top-left of BoundingBox)
Axes start from the center of the circle. If the arrow is straight, the center is in the Middle of the arrow.

negative angle: CW(!)
positive angle: CCW
Shaft spacing !=0 => arrow is double-lined, no other attributes needed for that, and no other ones can accomplish that
ArrowType: Selects type of arrow (head and tail). As said, that does not yet affect whether it is double-lined
ArrowHeadHead: Head of arrow
ArrowHeadTail: Tail of arrow
Major/Minor axis: Major axis usually points positively-parallelic to start-end-axis, but not necessarily
Minor axis usually points 90Â° clockwise to it. the ninety degrees are not necessary in the chemdraw format, otherwise the circle is sheared accordingly,
but in lhendraw, the axes of a circular arrow MUST be perpendicular to each other, and the arrow gets transformed accordingly.
The Minor axis should be clockwise to the Major axis.
However, if it is not clockwise, and angularsize stays the same, the arrow is not flipped. Likewise, inverting the vector of the Major axis has no effect.
The lhendraw controls, however, refer to the start-to-end axis, which is not necessarily parallelic to the Major or Minor axis.
