ldxml differs from cdxml in the following points:
If a field is undefined, it is the same as if it would have zero as its value.
The format is unicode-type. All text-field symbols above 0x79 are plain unicode characters.
groups are not containing their contents, but only a list of the id's of their contents.
bezier points, however, are contained.
colors are coded as ARGB integers directly: Byte0: blue, Byte1: green Byte2: red, Byte3: Alpha, 0x00 Opaque, 0xFF:Translucent
However, this translucence means, that the superior color is used.
